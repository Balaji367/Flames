    <h1 class="primary">how to play a Flames game?</h1>
    <div class="underline"></div>
    <p class="secondary">Here we took an example that helps you to understand the concept easily.
      Take a paper and note down your name and your partner’s name. For example here we took MOBILE and LANDLINE.
      Now strikeout all the matching letters in both names and note down the remaining letters. I got MOB and ANDLN.
      Now count the remaining letters here my count is 8.
      Here is the main part of the game.<br> Write FLAMES on your paper.<br>
      FLAMES<br>
      Now count 8 from the left side (from letter F) and strike the 8th letter and note down the remaining letters.
      FAMES<br>
      Now from the letter where you stopped previously again start counting up to 8th letter. This time my word becomes:
      FAMS<br>
      Again do the same
      FAS<br>
      Again repeat the same.
      AS
      Repeat it again to get single letter.
      A<br>
      Now A is the last letter which means “Affection”. So your partner will have affection on you.<br>
      That’s it. Hope you understand the above mention steps feel free to us if any doubts occurs. Don’t be late start playing Flames game now and find your relationship with your partner.</p>
